More Matroska validation tests
Improved reports
Verbosity option
MediaConch server, with a REST API

Matroska: negative timecodes were not correctly handled
Better support of non-English filenames
Display format is applied also on invalid files
Implementation tests now load logic from an XML representation of the Matroska EBML Schema
Implementation tests on valid parent elements, element multiplicity, mandated child elements
MediaTrace now documents the parser used for raw streams within Matroska.

Count of subtitle elements
Frame rate detection algorithm revisited
Showing precision of 1/1.001 frame rates (e.g. "23.976 (24000/1001) fps" and "23.976 (23976/1000) fps")

Version 15.10, 2015-11-02
