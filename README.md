DPF Manager: Digital Preservation Formats Manager (Image files)

Easy Innova proposes the development of a unique open platform specially designed to be a reference on conformance validation and file preparation of multiple standard formats for long-term preservation. One of its main features will be the capability to be integrated with other open source projects and proprietary applications, providing in a simple way a great range of tools to gain full control over the validation and preservation of digital content. The platform will be strategically modularized and prepared to easily incorporate conformance checkers for other formats and other multiple value-added functionalities (viewers, conversion, repair, optimization, ...).
